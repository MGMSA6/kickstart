🚀 Kickstart – Android Project Initializer

Kickstart is an Android Studio / IntelliJ plugin that bootstraps Android projects the same way Spring Initializr does for backend development.

It generates project structure, core classes, and dependencies so developers can start building features immediately instead of spending hours on setup and configuration.

🎯 What Problem Does Kickstart Solve?

Starting a new Android project usually means:

. Creating folders manually

. Deciding architecture

. Adding dependencies

. Configuring Gradle, KSP, DI, networking, persistence

. Writing repetitive boilerplate

. Kickstart automates all of this.

👉 You focus on business logic and screens, not project setup.
