🚀 Kickstart

Kickstart is an Android Studio plugin that helps you instantly bootstrap your project with a clean, scalable architecture — without manual setup.

It generates folder structures, core boilerplate, and best-practice scaffolding so you can start building features immediately.✨ Supported Architectures

Kickstart currently supports the following design patterns:

🧩 MVP (Model–View–Presenter)

Clear separation of View and Presenter

Easy to test presentation logic

Suitable for legacy or XML-based projects

🧠 MVVM (Model–View–ViewModel)

Modern Android recommended architecture

Lifecycle-aware components

Clean separation of UI and business logic

Ideal for Jetpack Compose and XML

🔄 MVI (Model–View–Intent)

Unidirectional data flow

Predictable state management

Great for complex UI states and Compose-first apps

🛠 What Kickstart Does

Based on the selected architecture, Kickstart automatically:

📁 Generates recommended project folder structure

⚙️ Adds required dependencies (Version Catalog or normal Gradle)

🧱 Creates core boilerplate classes (DI, networking, utilities)

📐 Applies architecture best practices

🚫 Avoids overwriting existing files (safe generation)
